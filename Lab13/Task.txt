Your task is to implement simple Database class.

The non-generic Database class should contain public generic methods:
TEntity Get<TEntity>(int id)
void Add<TEntity>(TEntity entity)
void Update<TEntity>(TEntity entity)
void Delete<TEntity>(int id)
TEntity should always be class implementing IEntity interface so you need add proper constraint

Add method adds object to the database and the object is serialized to the file.
We use XmlSerializer to serialize objects - you need to modify some classes to make XmlSerializer work.
Every serialized object implements IEntity so it contains Id property.
The object is serialized to file _baseDir\[ObjectTypeName]_[Id].xml where: 
- [ObjectTypeName] is the name of the object class. You can retrieve name of object type using below code line:
    var typeName = typeof(TEntity).Name;
- [Id] is the sequence number of the serialized object with the same type
If the object with the given Id and the same type exists, the exception should be thrown.
If Id == 0 it should be changed by (max Id of serialized objects of given type) + 1.

Get method retrieves an object from the database.
If the object with the given Id does not exist, the exception should be thrown.

Update method updates object in the database.
If the object with the given Id does not exist, the exception should be thrown.

Delete method deletes object from the database.
If the object with the given Id does not exist, the exception should be thrown.

Additional requirements:
- You need to modify some classes (User/Order/Product) to allow serialize classes with XmlSerialize
- The property FullName of User class should be computed (FirstName + " " + LastName) and it should not be serialized
- You can create Order object only by its 3-parameters constructor

Tips:
- Directory.Exists([path])
- Directory.GetFiles([path])
- Directory.CreateDirectory([path])
- Path.Combine([path part 1], [path part 2])
- File.Exists([path])
- File.Delete([path])
- Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension([path])

Points:
- required modifications of User/Order/Product classes - 0.5p
- Add - 1.5p
- Get  - 1p
- Update - 1p
- Delete - 1p
